  abstract  = {Metagenomic sequencing has greatly improved our ability to
               profile the composition of environmental and host-associated
               microbial communities. However, the dependency of most methods
               on reference genomes, which are currently unavailable for a
               substantial fraction of microbial species, introduces estimation
               biases. We present an updated and functionally extended tool
               based on universal (i.e., reference-independent), phylogenetic
               marker gene (MG)-based operational taxonomic units (mOTUs)
               enabling the profiling of >7700 microbial species. As more than
               30\% of them could not previously be quantified at this
               taxonomic resolution, relative abundance estimates based on
               mOTUs are more accurate compared to other methods. As a new
               feature, we show that mOTUs, which are based on essential
               housekeeping genes, are demonstrably well-suited for
               quantification of basal transcriptional activity of community
               members. Furthermore, single nucleotide variation profiles
               estimated using mOTUs reflect those from whole genomes, which
               allows for comparing microbial strain populations (e.g., across
               different human body sites).},
